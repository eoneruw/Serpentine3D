Serpentine3D (`serp3d`) is a freeform surface modeller in the spirit of Rhinoceros 3D —
BREP/NURBS geometry on the OpenCASCADE kernel, not meshes. It is built for set
designers, architects, and industrial designers who want a genuine Rhino-style
workflow: a command line that prompts for input, layers, object snaps to a
construction plane, STEP/OBJ/FBX interchange, and a dark, focused interface.
The whole modelling engine also runs headless, so the same geometry you build by
hand can be scripted, batch-processed, or driven by an AI.

Named after the serpentine stone of Zimbabwean Shona sculpture, and the
S-curve at the heart of NURBS geometry.

## Why

- **No open-source freeform NURBS surface modeller exists.** FreeCAD is
  parametric solid CAD; Blender is mesh-based. Serpentine3D fills the
  freeform surface-modelling gap — on Linux, Windows and macOS alike.
- **First CAD tool with native AI integration.** The bundled MCP server lets
  Claude (or any MCP client) see your viewport, create geometry, run any
  command, and manage the scene.
- **Headless-first.** The modelling core is fully decoupled from the GUI —
  script it (`serp3d-batch`), import it as a Python library, or drive it over
  MCP. Repeatable, configurable, light, CI-friendly.

## Install

### Download

| Platform | Download | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux** | [`Serpentine3D-x86_64.AppImage`](https://github.com/chisomobanzi/Serpentine3D/releases/latest/download/Serpentine3D-x86_64.AppImage) | `chmod +x` and run — nothing to install |
| **Windows** | [`Serpentine3D-Setup-x86_64.exe`](https://github.com/chisomobanzi/Serpentine3D/releases/latest/download/Serpentine3D-Setup-x86_64.exe) | Installer (Inno Setup) |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | [`Serpentine3D-arm64.dmg`](https://github.com/chisomobanzi/Serpentine3D/releases/latest/download/Serpentine3D-0.9.1-arm64.dmg) | Drag to Applications |

Each download bundles the OpenCASCADE kernel and Python runtime — nothing else to
install. The GUI needs a GPU with OpenGL 3.3 drivers, which any normal desktop
has; GPU-less VMs and remote-desktop sessions that only expose OpenGL 1.1 get a
clear message instead of a viewport. Headless use (`serp3d-batch`, the MCP
server, file conversion) works anywhere.

### From source

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chisomobanzi/Serpentine3D && cd Serpentine3D
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
.venv/bin/serp3d        # launch
```

The OpenCASCADE kernel installs as pip wheels (`cadquery-ocp`) — no conda, no
system packages. The same install works on Linux, Windows and macOS; the full
test suite (360+ tests) passes on all three.

## The command line

Everything works Rhino-style: type a command, answer its prompts. Prompts accept
typed coordinates (`10,5,0`, relative `@5,0,0`) or viewport clicks on the
construction plane. `Tab` completes command names, `Up`/`Down` recall history,
`Enter` on an empty line repeats the last command, `Escape` cancels. As in Rhino,
a **right-click in the viewport acts as Enter** — it runs whatever you've typed,
commits a value mid-command, or repeats the last command.

| | Commands |
|---|---|
| **Curves** | `line` `polyline` `curve` (NURBS by control points) `interpcrv` (through the points) `circle` `arc` `ellipse` `rectangle` `helix` `textobject` `blendcrv` `project` `pull` `intersect` |
| **Surfaces** | `extrude` `revolve` `loft` `sweep1` `sweep2` `planarsrf` `patch`/`networksrf` `offsetsrf` `unrollsrf` |

| **Transform** | `move` `copy` `rotate` `scale` `scalenu` `mirror` `array` |
| **Edit** | `join` `explode` `trim` `split` `offset` `fillet` `rebuild` `pointson`/`pointsoff` (control points, curves *and* surfaces) `dir`/`flip` (curve direction and surface normals) `delete` `hide` `show` `rename` `undo` `redo` |
| **Select** | `selall` `selnone` `selcrv` `selsrf` `selsolid` `sellayer` `selname` `sellast` `invert` `isolate` `unisolate` |
| **Organise** | `group`/`ungroup` `lock`/`unlockall` `lockother` (lock all but the picked) `block` `insert` `blocklist` `count` `bringtofront`/`sendtoback` `bringforward`/`sendbackward` (draw order) |
| **Camera** | `camera` (lens mm, cinema sensors, placement, 2.39/1.85 frame guides) `units` `cplane` |
| **Array** | `array` (grid) `arraypolar` `arraypath` (along a curve) |
| **Analysis** | `distance` `length` `area` `volume` `curvature` `zebra` `curvaturegraph` (combs) `draftanalysis` `printcheck` (3D-print readiness: watertight, thin walls, overhangs, size) |
| **View** | `top` `front` `right` `perspective` `4view`/`1view` `zoomextents` `undoview`/`redoview` (a history for the camera, per pane) `wireframe` `shaded` `ghosted` `rendered` `technical` `meshquality` `grid` `snap` |
| **Render** | `material` (Matte/Plastic/Metal/Glass/custom PBR — flows into GLB/USD export) `rendered` |
| **Capture** | `turntable` (clean model clip) `turntableui` (portrait story with the app UI) |
| **Layers** | `layer` (new/current/show/hide/rename/weight/**linetype**) — or use the Layers panel |
| **Linetypes** | `linetype` — dashed/dotted/hidden/center/… per object or ByLayer (layers carry a linetype too); dashes render in the viewport *and* in exported layout sheets (PDF/SVG) |
| **Meshes** | heavy OBJ/3DM/FBX props stay native meshes (instant display); `meshtobrep` / `breptomesh` convert |
| **Files** | `new` `open` `save` `import` `export` (`.serp` is a zip container with thumbnail + metadata) |
| **Live** | `recordhistory` — loft/extrude/revolve outputs rebuild when their input curves are edited |

Most commands have Rhino-compatible aliases (`l`, `pl`, `c`, `m`, `co`, `mi`, ...).
Command options appear as **clickable chips** under the prompt
(`Cap=Yes`, `BothSides=No`, `Style=Normal`) and can be typed
Rhino-style (`cap=n`) at any moment without losing your place; numeric
prompts show a live **gold ghost preview** of the result while you
type. `help` (or F1) opens a searchable command reference. Arrow keys
nudge the selection along the CPlane (Shift ×10, Ctrl ×0.1).

### Navigation & shortcuts

- Launch with a file: `serp3d model.serp` (or any importable format)

## Drafting & documentation

Serpentine3D has a full two-space drafting workflow — model in 3D, document
in 2D, print to PDF — without leaving the app:

![A drafting sheet with dimensioned detail views and hidden-line rendering](assets/screenshot-drafting.png)

- **Layouts** (`layout`): paper-space sheets (A4–A0, Letter, Tabloid or
  custom) with tabs at the bottom of the viewport: `[Model] [Sheet 1] …`
- **Detail views** (`detail`): live windows into the model placed on the
  sheet — pick two corners, a view direction (top/front/right/…/perspective)
  and a scale (`1:10`, `1:50`, …). Double-click a detail to *enter* it,
  then pan (nav-button drag) and zoom (wheel changes the scale); click
  outside to exit. `detailscale`, `detailmode`, `detaillock`,
  `detailborder`, `detaildelete` manage the active detail.
- **Hidden-line rendering**: each detail can be *technical* (hidden lines
  removed), *hidden* (dashed hidden lines), *wireframe* or *shaded* —
  powered by OCCT's HLR engine, isolated in a worker process so degenerate
  geometry can never crash the app. The same engine drives the model-space
  `technical` display mode.
- **`make2d`**: project the current view (or a selection) into real,
  editable 2D curves on `Make2D visible` / `Make2D hidden` layers.
- **Annotations**: multiline `text`, `leader`, `dim` / `dimradius` /
  `dimdiameter` / `dimangle`, `hatch` (pick corners or **Mode=Region**
  to click inside detail linework), `scalebar`, `titleblock`,
  `sheetindex` and per-sheet `revision` tables. Everything on a sheet
  is selectable — drag to move, grips resize detail frames, Delete
  removes, `annotedit` edits — and dimensions picked inside a detail
  are **associative**: they re-project when the detail pans or
  rescales. `dimstyle` manages named text/arrow styles.
- **`exportpdf`** (Ctrl+P): true vector PDF — linework stays crisp at any
  zoom; shaded details are embedded as rendered images. Layouts save/load
  with the `.serp` file.

### The gumball

![The gumball with a face selected for push/pull editing](assets/screenshot-gumball.png)

Select anything and a **gumball** appears: drag the arrows to move along
an axis, the pads to move in a plane, the circles to rotate (Shift snaps
to 15°), the square knobs to scale along an axis (Shift = uniform).
Alt-drag moves a copy. Escape cancels a drag. `gumball` toggles it.

Ctrl+Shift-click a **face** of a solid and the gumball becomes a push/pull
handle along the face normal — drag it, or type a distance, to extrude the
face outward or carve it inward; the solid rebuilds live and the handle
stays on the moved face for repeated pulls. A **curved face** (a cylinder
or cone wall, a sphere) offsets instead — push it to grow or shrink the
radius, adjacent faces extending to meet it. Select **several faces** and
one handle offsets them all together, each along its own normal — inflate a
shape, or grow a slab from both sides at once.

Each axis carries two boxes. The **filled** one on the shaft **extrudes**: a
curve grows a surface along the axis and stays where it is, a closed curve
gives you the solid it encloses, and a surface becomes the solid it sweeps
out. A selected **edge** grows a surface of its own and leaves the object it
came off alone. The filled box only appears on an axis where there is
something to grow, so a solid does not offer one at all, and a flat surface
offers one only on the axis it faces: swept the other two ways it would
come back as the surface it already is. Ctrl and a translate arrow does
the same thing if that is the habit you arrived with.

The **hollow** box on the far side of the pivot, at the end of the dashed
leader that mirrors the arrow, is **scale**. Type a distance for either
instead of dragging.

Ctrl+Shift-click one or more **edges** and the gumball becomes a fillet
handle — drag it outward, or type a radius, to round the edges; every
selected edge fillets together at that radius, previewing live. Hold
**Alt** while dragging to chamfer instead of fillet.

### Units

`units` sets the document units (mm/cm/m/in/**feet-and-inches**) with an
optional model rescale. Every prompt then accepts unit input — `3'6"`,
`2' 4 1/2"`, `30cm`, `1.5in` — and coordinates support polar entry
(`10<45`) and Shift-ortho constraint while picking. **Tab** locks the
direction you are pointing in for any direction, not just the four ortho
ones, leaving the cursor to set only the distance along it.

### Scripting & automation

The modelling engine runs with or without a GUI, so anything you can do by
hand can be automated:

- **Python console** (Tools menu, Ctrl+`): the live scene, geometry
  builders and the full API in an interactive session.
- **`serpentine3d.scripting.Document`**: the same power headless —
  `doc.add(geo.make_box(...))`, `doc.run("filletedge", [...])`,
  `doc.export("part.step")`. The command layer is decoupled from Qt, so
  every interactive command runs offscreen.
- **`serp3d-batch script.py`**: run scripts from the command line / CI
  with `doc`, `geo` and `args` predefined. No display needed.
- **MCP server** (`serp3d-mcp`): the same modelling surface as tools an AI
  agent can call — full CRUD over the scene (see below).
- **Autosave & crash recovery**: every 5 minutes (configurable); on
  launch after a crash Serpentine3D offers to restore the autosave.
- Drop a `~/.config/serpentine3d/template.serp` to start every new
  document from your own template (units, layers, title blocks).

### Settings

**Tools → Settings** (Ctrl+,) — five flat pages, changes apply instantly:

- **Mouse** — orbit with the middle *or right* mouse button, scroll
  direction, orbit/zoom speed
- **Keyboard** — bind any key to any command; import from a text file
  (`F5 zoomextents` per line) or JSON
- **Aliases** — custom command aliases; **imports Rhino alias exports**
  (Options → Aliases → Export) and maps known commands automatically
- **Object Snaps** and **Display** (grid size); the Display panel's **Mesh** row picks how finely curved surfaces are cut into triangles (Coarse/Normal/Fine/Very fine — Fine or above keeps a mirror-like Rendered reflection from showing the triangles as creases)

Settings live in `~/.config/serpentine3d/settings.json`.

## The assistant (AI modelling)

![The AI assistant modelling geometry alongside the viewport](assets/screenshot-assistant.png)

Serpentine3D has a built-in AI assistant: open it from the View menu (or
type `ai`, or Ctrl+Shift+A), describe what you want, and it builds real
BREP geometry in your live scene —

> *a spiral staircase, 3 m tall, 14 steps, 900 mm radius*
> *fillet every edge of the box 2 mm*
> *what's the volume of the hull?*

It works with the full command set (the same commands you type), can
measure and inspect the scene, and can **look at the viewport** — it
takes a screenshot, checks its own work, and fixes mistakes before
answering. Everything it does streams into the panel as it happens, and
everything is undoable.

Bring your own Anthropic API key (Settings → Assistant, or the
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable — get one at
[console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)). Usage is billed
to your Anthropic account; the assistant never phones home anywhere
else, and the key never leaves your machine except to call the API.

## MCP server (AI integration)

Prefer driving Serpentine3D from an external agent (Claude Code, Claude
Desktop)? The same modelling surface is exposed as MCP tools. Start the
app, then register the server with your MCP client:

```bash
claude mcp add serpentine3d -- /path/to/.venv/bin/serp3d-mcp
```

Tools: `serp_scene_info`, `serp_screenshot` (returns an image of the viewport),
`serp_create_curve`, `serp_create_surface`, `serp_boolean`, `serp_transform`,
`serp_select`, `serp_command` (run any command with its interactive inputs),
`serp_layers`, `serp_import`, `serp_export`, `serp_measure`, `serp_undo`,
`serp_viewport`.

The combination of `serp_screenshot` and `serp_command` means an AI assistant
can model alongside you: it sees what you see and can operate every tool the
command line offers. The bridge is a localhost-only JSON-RPC socket
(`~/.serpentine3d/rpc.port`); set `SERP3D_NO_RPC=1` to disable it.

## Architecture

```

Geometry is exact BREP on OpenCASCADE 7.9 (via the `OCP` pybind11 bindings);
the viewport tessellates on demand with trim-aware isocurve display. Commands
are Python generators that yield typed input requests — the same command code
serves typed input, viewport clicks, and MCP calls.

## Plugins

Drop a `.py` file into `~/.serpentine3d/plugins/` defining
`serpentine3d_plugin(ctx)`, or ship a package with a
`serpentine3d.plugins` entry point — plugins register first-class
commands (with prompts, osnaps, undo and MCP support for free) and
menu items. See `docs/scripting.md`.

## Development

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest            # unit tests (geometry, scene, commands, file I/O)
```

## Keep the lights on
