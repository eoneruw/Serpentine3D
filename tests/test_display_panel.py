"""Turning surface isocurves and edges off, and a panel to do it in (#5).

Isocurves were drawn in every display mode, including rendered, with no
way to switch them off: `rendered` only swapped the fill colour. On a
surveyed model that is a wire cage over everything, and the reporter asked
for what Rhino has, a Display panel beside Properties.

Two levels, as in Rhino. Each mode has a sensible default, and rendered's
is isocurves off, because a render is not a wireframe. On top of that sits
a per-viewport override for when the default is not what you want, and it
sticks until you clear it rather than resetting under you on a mode change.
