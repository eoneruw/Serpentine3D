"""The app has to start on drivers that go through EGL, not just GLX.

Reported from Manjaro/KDE/Wayland on an RTX 3080: the welcome window
came up spewing `QEGLPlatformContext: Failed to create context: 3009`
(EGL_BAD_MATCH) and New Model did nothing. Two separate faults, both of
them "we assumed GLX".

First, the format. We ask for OpenGL 3.3 **Core profile** but left
`renderableType` at its default, and on the EGL path Qt then binds
OpenGL **ES**, which has no core profile: EGL_BAD_MATCH, every context,
including the one Qt's own widget backing store needs.

Second, PyOpenGL, which picks its driver binding once, at import, by
reading the environment: EGL if the session says Wayland, GLX
otherwise. Qt picks its own, by asking the driver. When the two guesses
disagree, PyOpenGL's `GetCurrentContext()` asks a binding that cannot
see Qt's context, it answers null, and the first GL call in
`initializeGL` raises "Attempt to retrieve context when no valid
context" - the viewport never draws, which is what "New Model does
nothing" looked like from outside.

They disagree in both directions: X11 where Qt went to EGL (NVIDIA, or
QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION=xcb_egl, which is how this was reproduced here),
and a Wayland session where Qt could not get a Wayland surface and fell
back to XWayland and GLX. So Qt is asked and PyOpenGL is told, rather
than both being left to guess.
