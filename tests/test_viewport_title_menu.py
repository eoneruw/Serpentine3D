"""Finding the four-viewport layout, and the menu on a viewport's title.

The layout existed and nobody found it (GitHub #5 asked for a feature that
had shipped). Two reasons: a new drawing opened in a single view, and the
way to change that was three levels down a menu. So a fresh install now
opens in four, and every viewport carries its own menu on its title bar —
which is also where the display modes live, so changing one view to
wireframe no longer means changing the one that happens to be active.

What is tested here is which viewport a menu acts on and what the title
says afterwards. How it looks is Chisomo's to judge.
